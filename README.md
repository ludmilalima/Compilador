# Compilador
This project features a C minus language compiler based on Professor Kenneth Louden's proposal in the book Compiler Construction: Principles and Practice.
\
\
The target environment is a unicycle MIPS processor.
\
\
The loucomp.zip file contains an example compiler project made available by Professor Kenneth Louden.
\
\
The LexicalCminus.txt file contains the lexical conventions of the C minus language.
\
\
The SyntaxCminus.png file contains the C minus language syntax.
\
\
The file SyntacticTreeStructure.png shows the construction of the syntactic tree in this project. 
\
\
Running the compiler:
1st) Save the C minus code file in the same folder as the compiler files (file_name.cm);
2nd) In the folder containing the compiler files, run the make command to execute the compiler generator script;
3rd) Run the compiler executable file named 'compiler' followed by the name of the file that will be compiled (./compiler file_name.cm).
